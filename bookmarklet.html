<h3>Bookie - Cross-browser Cookie Handling</h3>
<p>
	Bookie is a tool that lets you view and manipulate the cookies on a domain.
</p>
<p>
	You will only see cookies that are on the same domain as the site you are currently on.
</p>
<p>
	Add the link below, "Bookie", as a bookmark. You can add these as toolbar buttons but the process is slightly different on each browser.
	<ul>
		<ul>Firefox/Chrome/Safari: Just drag the link to your toolbar.</ul>
		<ul>Internet Explorer(all): Right-click on the link and choose "Add to Favorites". In the Add Favorite dialog window, select the Links folder under Favorites.</ul>
	</ul>
	
	<strong>**You may need to make your Links toolbar visible if it isn't already.</strong>
</p>
<p>	
	This is the bookmarklet: 
	<a href="javascript:(function(){var bookiescript = document.createElement('script');bookiescript.type='text/javascript';bookiescript.src='http://svn.cnet.com/lifestyle/widgets/bookie/bookie.js';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(bookiescript);})()">Bookie</a>
